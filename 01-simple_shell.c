/**
 * main - Main function for a simple shell
 *
 * Description:
 * 	This function implements a basic shell, which repeatedly prompts
 * 	the user for input, reads the input, tokenizes it into individual
 * 	commands, and executes those commands. It supports built-in commands
 * 	like "cd" to change the current working directory and "exit" to exit
 * 	the shell.
 *
 * 	The main loop continues until the user enters the "exit" command or
 * 	encounters an error while reading input. The function frees memory
 * 	allocated for input and tokens after processing each command.
 *
 * Return: returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the shell
